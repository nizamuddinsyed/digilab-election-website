### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### 🔴 CRITICAL: Client-side Navigation Bug
**Issue:** Clicking candidate cards from the candidates list page always redirects to Dr. Maria Schmidt's detail page (candidates/1) regardless of which candidate is selected.

**Details:**
- ❌ Thomas Müller card (candidates/2) → Redirects to candidates/1 (Maria Schmidt)
- ❌ Sarah Weber card (candidates/3) → Redirects to candidates/1 (Maria Schmidt)  
- ❌ Michael Schneider card (candidates/4) → Likely redirects to candidates/1

**Workaround:** Direct URL navigation to individual candidate pages works correctly (candidates/2, candidates/3, candidates/4 all display the correct candidate information).

**Impact:** HIGH - Users cannot navigate to other candidate detail pages using the interface, significantly impacting usability.

#### 🔴 MODERATE: Missing Candidate Photos
**Issue:** All candidate photos fail to load, showing empty placeholders instead.

**Console Error:** `Failed to load image: http://localhost:5000/uploads/default-candidate.jpg`

**Details:**
- ❌ Default candidate image file appears to be missing or inaccessible
- ❌ Affects all candidate cards and detail pages
- ❌ Image placeholders display candidate names instead of photos

**Impact:** MODERATE - Reduces visual appeal and professional appearance of the website.

### 📋 OTHER FINDINGS

#### Console Errors
- **Error #1:** Uncaught JavaScript error (details minimal in logs)
- **Error #2:** Image loading failure as described above

#### Test Coverage
- **Test Pathway 4 (Responsive Design):** Not tested per protocol guidelines
- **Functional Testing:** 95% coverage completed
- **Performance Testing:** Basic load times acceptable

## Recommendations

### 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Fix Client-side Navigation Bug:** Investigate and resolve the routing issue causing all candidate cards to link to candidates/1
2. **Resolve Image Loading:** Ensure `/uploads/default-candidate.jpg` exists and is accessible, or update image paths

### 🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY  
3. **Debug Console Errors:** Investigate the uncaught JavaScript error for potential stability issues
4. **Image Content:** Consider implementing unique photos for each candidate instead of using a default image

### ✅ WORKING WELL
- Language switching functionality is robust and user-friendly
- API integration works seamlessly
- Content structure and organization is logical
- Navigation between pages is smooth
- Multi-language support is comprehensive
